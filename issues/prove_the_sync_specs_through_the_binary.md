# Prove the sync specs through the binary

# Goal
Move the proofs of `specs/sync.md` for `init`, `sync`, `update`, `check` and the managed settings entries from
internal unit tests to tests that run the `harness` binary on temporary directories, so the spec and its tests
form an acceptance suite that survives a rewrite of the code.

# Findings
* Split from `prove_the_specs_with_black_box_tests` by size (2026-10-27).
* `crates/harness/src/tests.rs` holds 32 `// spec: SYN-n` citations and `crates/harness/src/tests/settings_entries.rs`
  20, all calling internal functions (`use super::*`).
* `crates/harness/tests/` already runs the built binary (`CARGO_BIN_EXE_harness`) in several files.

# Approach
1. Per group of requirements (init and sync, update, check, settings entries), write the boundary test that proves
   each one through the command line, files, exit code and output; move the `// spec:` citation to it.
2. Keep an internal test that adds detail as a unit test without a citation; drop the ones the boundary test covers.

# Specs
* `specs/sync.md`: content unchanged, only its proofs move.

# Resources
* `crates/harness/src/tests.rs`, `crates/harness/src/tests/settings_entries.rs`, `crates/harness/tests/`
* `files/specs/README.md` (the tracing rule)

# Hints
* After `prove_the_specs_with_black_box_tests`: it sets the rule and reports the internal-only proofs this issue
  removes.
* Black-box tests through the binary are slower; keep them on temp dirs with no network, per `CLAUDE.md`.

Plan: validated

## Understanding
Re-prove SYN-1 to SYN-17 and SYN-29 to SYN-36 by running the `harness` binary (`init`, `sync`, `update`, `check`) on
temp dirs, asserting files, exit code, stdout and stderr; the internal tests either lose their citation (kept as unit
detail: `set_rev`, `is_full_hash`) or are dropped. Out of scope: SYN-18 to SYN-28 (install gate, warnings, retention:
`prove_the_run_and_gate_specs_through_the_binary`), except the citation SYN-25, SYN-26, SYN-27 of the settings test
that moves with it. Offline: local or `file://` sources, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` in a temp dir, a fake failing `cargo` first
on the `PATH` so the prefetch of the tools binary (BIN-13) builds nothing.

## Plan
1. [x] Init, sync and check: shared helpers `crates/harness/tests/common/mod.rs` (run the binary, put/get, a source),
   `crates/harness/tests/sync_cli.rs`, the matching tests of `src/tests.rs` dropped; verified by `just check` and
   `check-specs` no longer listing them; makes true SYN-1 to SYN-10 (~650 lines).
2. [ ] Update: `crates/harness/tests/update_cli.rs` on a local git source, internal update tests dropped, `set_rev`
   and `is_full_hash` kept uncited; makes true SYN-11 to SYN-17 (~650 lines).
3. [ ] Settings entries: `crates/harness/tests/settings_entries_cli.rs`, `src/tests/settings_entries.rs` dropped;
   makes true SYN-29 to SYN-36 (~850 lines).

## Decisions
- Mode: autonomous
- Base commit: 9d11cef45c6773bc0af41451336fd0836f3a47c7

## Deliverable 1
- done: `tests/common/mod.rs` (binary in a temp home: cache, user settings, failing `cargo`), `tests/sync_cli.rs`
  proves SYN-1 to SYN-10 through `init`, `sync`, `check`; their internal tests of `src/tests.rs` dropped.
- red: none (the behaviour exists: the proofs move, no test can fail before the code)
- Code review: 1 findings; the possible dead helpers and imports of `src/tests.rs` after the drop: not a defect,
  `just check` (clippy `-D warnings`) passes, the remaining tests use them (`use super::*` raises no unused warning).
- not verified: none
- decisions needed: none
