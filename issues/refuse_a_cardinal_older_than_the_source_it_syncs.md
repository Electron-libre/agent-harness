# Refuse a cardinal older than the source it syncs

# Goal
An installed `cardinal` older than the source revision it syncs, or than the lock it reads, misreads the managed
content without saying so. `update` and `sync` must tell the user to install the matching `cardinal` instead of
syncing wrongly or failing with an obscure error.

# Findings
* Found by the `high` review of `allow_cardinal_run_in_the_synced_projects` (ADR 0013): the managed entries now hold
  `permissions.allow` rules.
* A binary from before ADR 0013 reads only `permissions.deny` and hooks in `entries/.claude/settings.json`: syncing a
  newer source drops the allow rule `Bash(cardinal run *)` silently, and the seed no longer carries it.
* The same binary reading a lock written by a newer one fails on an `entry {"allow": ...}` line with
  `not a settings entry` (exit 3), without saying to upgrade.
* The guard of `update` against an outdated binary (`launcher::refused`) only checks that the installed launcher
  accepts the hook subcommands; it does not see a change of the fragment or lock format.

# Approach
1. A format version: the source declares the minimum `cardinal` version it needs (in `entries/` or a source file),
   the lock records it; `sync`, `update` and `check` refuse with the install command when the running binary is
   older.
2. Or narrower: an unknown key in the fragment, or an unknown entry line in the lock, is an error that names the
   upgrade, instead of being ignored or reported as a malformed entry.

# Specs
* `specs/sync.md`: a new requirement next to SYN-29 and SYN-30.

# Resources
* `crates/cardinal/src/entries.rs` (`of_source`, `from_lock`), `crates/cardinal/src/launcher.rs` (`refused`),
  `crates/cardinal/src/lib.rs` (`update`)
* ADR 0007, ADR 0013, `issues/done/install_the_new_harness_before_merging_a_hook_change.md`

# Hints
* A binary already released cannot be changed: only the binaries from this issue on can refuse a newer source.

# Tracking

Plan: validated

## Understanding
`sync`/`update` refuse a source whose declared format (`cardinal-format`, a whole number) exceeds the one compiled in
the binary, and `sync`/`update`/`check` a lock that records a higher one, naming the install command (approach 1 of
the issue, a format integer rather than the crate version, never raised). Out of scope: the binaries already released.

## Plan
1. [x] Source format: `cardinal-format` at the root (2), `FORMAT` in the binary kept equal by a test, `sync` and
   `update` refuse a higher one with the install command; verified by tests of `sync_from`, `update_in` and the
   format test; makes true SYN-40, SYN-43.
2. [x] Lock format: `write_lock` records `format <n>`, `read_lock` reads it, `check`, `sync` and `update` refuse a
   higher one with the install of the head of the source; ADR 0014 accepted, docs; verified by lock tests; makes
   true SYN-41, SYN-42.

## Decisions
- Mode: autonomous
- Base commit: `896f6210b22ceb668c24dd7fbfb9255afc00130b`
- The format is declared in `cardinal-format` at the root of the source.
- The lock records the format of the binary that wrote it; its refusal installs the head of the source.
- Format 2 is the one of ADR 0013; no declaration means 1.
- `--dry-run` refuses too.

## Deliverable 1

- done: `cardinal-format` (2) at the root, `FORMAT` in the binary, `sync` and `update` refuse a newer source with
  the install command, `--dry-run` included.

## Deliverable 2

- done: the lock records `format <n>`; `check`, `sync` and `update` refuse a lock of a newer format with the install
  of the head of the source; ADR 0014 and `specs/sync.md` accepted; this repository's lock resynced.
