# Rename the harness-named tools to cardinal

# Goal
Rename what still carries "harness" as the product name once the binary and files are renamed: the skill
`evaluate-harness`, the tools `harness-report` and `harness-changes`, the spec `harness-verdicts`, the commit scope
`harness`, the CI workflow `harness.yml` and the recipe `check-harness`.

# Findings
* `evaluate-harness` appears in 25 lines of 14 files, `harness-report` in 28 lines of 16 files, `harness-changes`
  in 21 lines of 12 files, `harness-verdicts` in 5 lines.
* `AGENTS.md` makes `harness` a scope that always exists (`.claude/`, `justfile`, CI); `check-commits` enforces it,
  and `harness-changes` may read past commits by it.
* `CLAUDE.md` defines the `Expected-effect` footer against the metrics of `harness-report`.

# Approach
1. Decide per name: rename to `cardinal-…`, or keep the generic noun where it means the concept (e.g.
   `evaluate-harness` evaluates an agent harness and may stay).
2. Keep reading the old commit scope in the history tools, so past commits still count.
3. `git mv` in a deliverable of its own, then the references, then `just sync`.

# Specs
* `specs/harness-report.md`, `specs/harness-verdicts.md` and the specs citing these tools; renamed or amended at
  `issue-workflow` step 1.

# Resources
* `files/.claude/skills/evaluate-harness/`, `crates/cardinal/src/tools/harness_report.rs`, `harness_changes.rs`
* `AGENTS.md`, `files/.github/workflows/harness.yml`, `justfile`

# Hints
* Also the product prose that `name_the_product_cardinal` left out of its scope: the specs (e.g. `specs/sync.md`
  "keeps the shared harness", `specs/harness-verdicts.md` "harness source") and the doc comments of the crate
  (`lib.rs`, `tools/harness_changes.rs`).
* After `rename_the_consumer_files_to_cardinal`.
* Renaming a skill changes the fixed context of every session and the skill names counted by `harness-report`:
  past sessions cite the old name.

# Tracking

Plan: validated

## Understanding
Rename to `cardinal-…` what names the product: the tools `harness-report`/`harness-changes` (and their modules,
tests, specs `harness-report.md`/`harness-verdicts.md`, ids REP/VRD kept), the commit scope, the CI workflow, the
recipe `check-harness`, and the product prose of the specs and doc comments. Out of scope: the `harness` binary
alias and the old-name fallbacks (`drop_the_harness_alias`), the gate mark `# harness: native review gate`.
No `FORMAT` raise: no fragment key, lock line or source layout changes meaning; `sync` deletes the old copies (SYN-5).

## Plan
1. [x] Moves: `git mv` of `specs/harness-{report,verdicts}.md` to `specs/cardinal-{report,verdicts}.md`,
   `tools/harness_{report,changes}.rs` and `tests/harness_{report,changes}.rs` to `cardinal_*`,
   `files/.github/workflows/harness.yml` to `cardinal.yml`, with only the `mod`/`use` lines and links that keep
   `just check` green, then `just sync`; verified by `just check`, `just check-harness`; ~60 lines + renames.
2. [x] Tool names: `cardinal run cardinal-report` and `cardinal-changes` (registry, usage strings, skills, docs,
   CLAUDE.md `Expected-effect`); verified by the tools CLI test through the new names and `tests/skills.rs`;
   makes true REP-3, VRD-3, VRD-5, VRD-7, VRD-8 amended; ~150 lines.
3. [x] Commit scope `cardinal`: `commit-check` built-in scopes `docs` and `cardinal`; `rule-breaches` reads
   `docs`, `cardinal` and `harness` (past commits); AGENTS.md, the `cardinal.toml` comments; verified by a
   commit-check test (`cardinal` accepted, `harness` refused) and a rule-breaches test (a past `harness` commit is no
   breach); makes true BRE-9 amended; ~80 lines.
4. [ ] CI and recipe: workflow `Cardinal` (job, concurrency group), recipe `check-cardinal`, `ci.yml`,
   `install_cardinal.sh`, README, docs, skills; verified by `just check-cardinal`, `just check-harness` (alias);
   ~80 lines.
5. [ ] Product prose: "the harness" meaning Cardinal becomes "Cardinal" in the specs (`sync.md`, REP, VRD, EVA,
   BIN titles and intents) and the crate doc comments and tool about strings; the generic "agent harness" stays;
   verified by `just check`; ~120 lines.

Specs amended in place (ids kept): REP-3, VRD-3, VRD-5, VRD-7, VRD-8 (tool names) in deliverable 2, BRE-9 (scope
`cardinal`, `harness` still read) in deliverable 3; prose only in deliverable 5.

## Decisions
- Mode: autonomous
- Base commit: e4cd7fcb4252a4e1989cdbe2768d983af7d15124
- `evaluate-harness` kept (the generic noun; its skill counts stay whole).
- `commit-check` refuses the scope `harness` (only `docs` and `cardinal`); `rule-breaches` still reads it.
- Workflow `cardinal.yml`, named `Cardinal`, job `cardinal`; a consumer's required check `harness` must be renamed (final report).
- Recipe `check-cardinal`, `alias check-harness` kept until `drop_the_harness_alias`.
- No alias for the old tool names (skills and binary are pinned together).

## Deliverable 1: moves
- done: the specs, tool modules, tool tests and the CI workflow moved to their `cardinal` names; links and `mod`
  lines follow; `sync` replaced `.github/workflows/harness.yml` by `cardinal.yml` (SYN-5).

| check | result |
|---|---|
| tests, lint, specs | `just check` passes |
| copies | `just check-harness` passes |
| docs | spec paths updated (CLAUDE.md, architecture, update-docs map, doc comments) |
| code review | low, see below |

- red: none (moves only, no behaviour)
- Code review: no findings
- not verified: the GitHub run of the renamed workflow (runs on push)
- decisions needed: none

## Deliverable 2: tool names
- done: the tools answer to `cardinal-report` and `cardinal-changes` (registry kept in alphabetical order, usage
  strings, `evaluate-harness`, specs REP-3 and VRD-3/5/7/8, CLAUDE.md, docs).

| check | result |
|---|---|
| tests, lint, specs | `just check` passes |
| copies | `just sync` then `just check-harness` pass |
| docs | usage, workflow, architecture, update-docs map, CLAUDE.md |
| code review | low, see below |

- red: REP-3, VRD-3, VRD-8: `cardinal: unknown tool \`cardinal-changes\``; `tests/skills.rs`: 2 failures (the skill
  named the old tools)
- Code review: no findings
- not verified: none
- decisions needed: none

## Deliverable 3: commit scope
- done: `commit-check` (and `check-commits`) accept `docs` and `cardinal`, refuse `harness`; `rule-breaches` reads
  `docs`, `cardinal` and `harness` (BRE-9 amended); AGENTS.md (scope and example) and the `cardinal.toml` comments.

| check | result |
|---|---|
| tests, lint, specs | `just check` passes |
| copies | `just sync` then `just check-harness` pass |
| docs | AGENTS.md, seed and project `cardinal.toml` comments, BRE-9 |
| code review | low, see below |

- red: BRE-9: a `fix(cardinal): v` commit counted as a `commit-format` breach; commit-check: `unknown scope \`cardinal\``
- Code review: no findings
- not verified: none
- decisions needed: none
