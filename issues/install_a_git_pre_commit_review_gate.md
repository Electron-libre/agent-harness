# Install a native git pre-commit hook as the last-resort review gate

# Goal
`harness init` and `harness sync` must install in each consumer a native git `pre-commit` hook that refuses a commit
whose repository holds a change the last code review never saw. Git runs it with `GIT_DIR` and the work tree already
resolved, so the gate no longer depends on reading the repository out of the text of the command, which
`require_code_review.rs` can only approximate.

# Findings
* `require_code_review.rs` parses the command line to find the repository a `git commit` lands in (`-C`, `--git-dir`,
  `--work-tree`, `GIT_DIR=`, `export`). Every new way to name a repository (`$X`, `$(…)`, fish `set -x`) is a bypass
  until the parser learns it.
* A `pre-commit` hook runs in the repository that really receives the commit, whatever the command looked like.
* It does not replace the Claude hook: `--no-verify` and `core.hooksPath` skip a native hook, and only the Claude hook
  can refuse them.
* Follow-up of `read_unreadable_repository_options_in_the_review_hook`, where validating the commit after its creation
  and rolling back was considered and rejected (the post-commit hook cannot tell which repository to reset).

# Approach
1. Decide how the hook reads the review marker of its repository (the same marker and snapshot as
   `require_code_review.rs`, shared code or a single binary entry such as `harness check-review`).
2. Install it from `harness init` / `harness sync`: a managed file under the git hooks directory, chained with a
   `pre-commit` the user already has (never overwritten silently), and re-installed when it drifts.
3. Cover the repositories reached through `--git-dir` and linked worktrees (hooks directory of the common git dir).
4. Make the Claude hook refuse `--no-verify`, `-n` and a `core.hooksPath` change on a `git commit` line.
5. Write an ADR: the gate moves from parsing the command to the repository, with the bypasses that remain.

# Specs
* `specs/review-gate.md`: new requirements for the native hook; `specs/sync.md` for its installation.

# Resources
* `files/.claude/hooks/require_code_review.rs`, `specs/review-gate.md`, `specs/sync.md`
* `crates/harness/` (`init`, `sync`, `check`), `docs/architecture.md` (the review gate), `docs/adr/README.md`

# Hints
* `.git/hooks` is not versioned and not copied by `git clone`: the consumer needs `harness sync` to install it.
* A consumer may set `core.hooksPath` itself; say what the tool does then instead of ignoring it.

# Tracking

1. [x] `native` mode of `require_code_review.rs` (REV-9, REV-10, REV-11). Done: tests (direct runs, a real `git commit` through an installed `pre-commit`, a linked worktree), `GIT_INDEX_FILE` ignored so `commit -a` sees the real index, `just check` / `test-harness` / `check-harness` green. Not verified: a `--git-dir` commit from a non-trivial cwd through real git (covered by `GIT_DIR` env runs only). Code review: see the commit.
2. [x] The Claude hook refuses `--no-verify`, `-n` and `core.hooksPath` on a `git commit` line (REV-12). Done: `skips_verification` (long abbreviations, bundles, option values skipped, `--`), `skips_hooks` (every commit of the line, each command read apart) and `sets_hooks_path` (per command: `-c`, `--config-env`, `git config key value`, `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n`, `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`; `--get`, `--unset`, a bare read and message words excepted); 36 cases in the test. Code review: 8 findings, fixed the `--get` scope, the later commits of a line, the displaced doc comment, `--trailer`, the false positives (unset, read, heredoc body) and the missing cases; the other ways of moving the hooks stay open (below). Not covered: `git config` through an alias or a shell variable, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` pointing at another file, `git -c include.path=…`, editing `.git/config` with a file tool; to cite in the ADR.
3. [x] `sync` installs the stub, chains a foreign hook, reinstalls on drift (SYN-18, SYN-19, SYN-20). Done: `crates/harness/src/gate.rs`, `Outcome::Moved`, 8 tests (the script is run with a fake `rust-script`: exit code, arguments, warning without review hook or `rust-script`, chaining order, `--dry-run`, idempotence); this repository now carries the gate (`just sync`). `init` alone does not install it (the review hook is not there yet): SYN-18 says so. Code review: 9 findings; fixed the mark read on the second line only, the install order (new hook staged first, gate installed before the managed files), a relative symlink moved with the user's hook, the git environment of the subprocess, `$0` without a slash and a loose test assertion; `core.hooksPath` (SYN-22) and the module claims are item 4. Not verified: Windows (the hook is `sh`).
4. [ ] Linked worktrees, `core.hooksPath` set by the consumer, project without git (SYN-21, SYN-22)
5. [ ] `check` reports a missing or modified native gate (SYN-23)
6. [ ] ADR 0004, docs, `just sync`, specs `accepted` then `implemented`

## Decisions

* Mode: autonomous (commit locally per deliverable, no push, review never skipped).
* The stub runs `rust-script .claude/hooks/require_code_review.rs native`: one code for the marker and the snapshot.
* `core.hooksPath` set by the consumer: install nothing, say so, `check` stays silent about it.
* A foreign `pre-commit` moves to `pre-commit.user` and is chained after the gate; never overwritten.
* Stub with no review hook or no `rust-script`: warn on stderr, let the commit through.
