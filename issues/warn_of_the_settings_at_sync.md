# Warn of the settings at sync

# Goal
`harness check` warns when the seeded `.claude/settings.json` lacks a deny rule of the review waiver, runs a hook
the project no longer has, or leaves the attribution on (SYN-24 to SYN-26). `harness sync` says nothing, yet it is
the sync that deletes a hook the source dropped (SYN-5): from then on the settings run a missing script and every
`Bash` call shows a hook error until someone runs `check`. Make the sync tell it at once.

# Findings
* Seen when `block_ai_attribution.rs` left `files/`: `sync` reported `removed: .claude/hooks/block_ai_attribution.rs`
  and nothing about the settings that still declare it; only `check` printed the missing hook.
* The warnings come from `settings::warnings` in `crates/harness/src/settings.rs`, called by `check_with` only.
* A hook whose script is missing exits 1, a non-blocking error in Claude Code: noise, not a refusal.

# Approach
1. After a sync (not a dry run), print the warnings of `settings::warnings` to stderr, without failing.
2. Or print them only when the sync removed a hook, or when the settings name a hook the sync just removed.
3. Under `--dry-run`, say which declared hooks the sync would leave missing.

# Specs
* `specs/sync.md`: amends SYN-25 and SYN-26 (and possibly SYN-24) so that `sync` prints them too.

# Resources
* `crates/harness/src/settings.rs`, `crates/harness/src/lib.rs` (`sync`, `check_with`), `crates/harness/src/main.rs`
* `specs/sync.md` (SYN-5, SYN-24 to SYN-26)
* `issues/done/drop_redundant_guards_and_prose_tests.md`

# Hints
* `sync` is also run by `update`: the warnings should come out once.

# Tracking

1. [x] `Report` carries the settings warnings, filled by `sync_from` after a real sync and printed to stderr by `sync`
   and `update` (once) (SYN-27, real sync).
2. [ ] Under `--dry-run`, the warnings are judged on the state the sync would leave: hooks it would remove are
   missing, hooks it would add are present (SYN-27, dry run); spec `accepted`.

## Decisions

* Mode: autonomous.
* Approach 1: every warning at each sync, as `check` does (not only when a hook was removed).
* Approach 3: `--dry-run` judges the state the sync would leave.
* A new requirement SYN-27 rather than rewording SYN-24 to SYN-26.

## Deliverable 1

* done: `Report.warnings` filled by `sync_from` after a real sync, printed to stderr by `print_changes` (so once for
  `sync` and for `update`); README, `docs/architecture.md` (and the stale `gate.rs` path of `DENY_RULES`) updated.
* checks: `just check` ok, `just test-harness` ok, specs ok (SYN-27 traced, spec `draft` until deliverable 2).
* code review: no findings.
* not verified: the exit code of the binary on a warning is not tested end to end (`print_changes` returns
  `conflicts() == 0`, unchanged).
